## Introduction
Hey! This is Vishnu. Currently working as a Software Engineer-Data. The term DATA always motivates me!
I love to solve data problems to provide accurate and reliable data. I always believe in "keep it simple but efficient" principle.
Duplication in my work motivates me to think out-of-the-box to create a way to automate that process.
I write clean code to promote better understanding and visibility for others.
